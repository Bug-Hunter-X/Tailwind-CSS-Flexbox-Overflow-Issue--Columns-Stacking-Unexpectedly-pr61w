```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="w-1/2 bg-gray-200 p-4">
    <!-- Content 1 -->
  </div>
  <div class="w-1/2 bg-gray-200 p-4">
    <!-- Content 2 -->
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flexbox layout with two equal-width columns. However, if the content within either column exceeds the available width, the layout may break unexpectedly, causing the columns to stack vertically instead of remaining side-by-side.

This happens because the `w-1/2` class assigns a width of 50% to each column. If the content width is greater than 50% of the container, it will overflow, causing the layout to break.

Another common issue is the improper use of `flex-wrap`. If you want to prevent wrapping, you need to set `flex-wrap: nowrap;`.

Sometimes, unexpected behavior results from the interaction between Tailwind's classes and other CSS rules.  Improperly nested components or conflicting styles from other sources can lead to hard-to-debug problems.
